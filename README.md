# AMSE 2023 Project

This repository is part of the 2023 AMSE course taught at FAU. It consists of `/exercises` given throughout the course, `/data` that is pulled from DWD and the city of Münster, and an individual `/project` that takes the data and compares it, analyses it, and packages all those findings up in a nice little jupyter notebook.

## Project

The project aims to find correlations between various weather metrics and bike traffic in the german city of Münster.
